# FordGoBike Consumer Habits
## by Rachel Strate


## Dataset

The data explored the August 2019 FordGoBike System data consisting of 210,563 entries and 14 features, to which I added the 4 key features: day of the week, time period, ride duration in minutes, and distance.  The original dataset can be found at https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html


## Summary of Findings

The habits of the users are very different and FordGoBike has two distinct consumer groups. The subscribers use the bikes possibly for communiting as the trips are mainly during the week days, are short in duration and distance, plus dropoff in use during the weekend. The consumer rental interest peaks from Friday onwards and even though the distance travelled isn't far they will use the rental for a longer duration.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I walked through the four key features and how they relate to the consumer groups, summarizing the findings at the end.
